**Abstract** This paper addresses a class of nonsmooth and nonconvex opti-
mization problems defined on complete Riemannian manifolds. The objec-
tive function has a composite structure, combining convex, differentiable, and
lower semicontinuous terms, thereby generalizing the classical framework of
difference-of-convex programming. Motivated by recent advances in proximal
point methods in both Euclidean and Riemannian settings, we propose two
variants of the proximal point method for solving this class of problems. The
first variant requires prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the gradient
of the smooth part, making it suitable when this parameter can be readily com-
puted. The second variant, in contrast, does not require such knowledge, thus
broadening its applicability. We analyze the complexity of both approaches,
establish their convergence, and illustrate their effectiveness through numerical
experiments.
